This class is so amazing it's the best part of my day everyday I wake up and wish I was here until I am and then I am screaming on the inside because I love it so much like on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is algebra 2 and 10 is this class in my opinion this class would be a 10 like on the walk up to lunch I am crying because I am leaving the class and I have to go to world civ next which is so much more boring compared to this absolutely beautiful class I am crying right now tears of joy describing it.
